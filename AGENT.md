# fairy-agent

fairy-agent is a small program you install on each computer you want to see in the Fairy panel. It answers the
panel's questions ("how busy is the CPU, how full are the disks, which programs are running...") over your
Tailscale network. It is one file, needs nothing else installed, and uses very little: about 15 MB of memory and
well under 1 % of one CPU core while the panel watches it every second.

Out of the box it only **reads**. It can also restart or shut down the machine, control a Supermicro server's
fans, or wake other computers on the network, but only if you switch each of those on yourself.

## What it never touches (anti-cheat safety)

fairy-agent was written so it can run on a gaming PC with kernel anti-cheat (Vanguard, EasyAntiCheat,
BattlEye, FACEIT...) without looking like a cheat:

* **No driver of any kind.** It does not install or load a driver: no WinRing0, no LibreHardwareMonitor or
  OpenHardwareMonitor, no inpout, nothing in the kernel. It only uses the normal, documented Windows functions
  that Task Manager and Performance Monitor use.
* **It never reads or writes another program's memory**, never injects anything into another program, never
  hooks anything, and never asks Windows for more than the weakest kind of access to another program
  ("query limited information": enough to ask how much CPU time and memory it used and where its .exe file
  is). If Windows says no, the agent quietly skips that program's details.
* You can tell it to **never even open** certain programs (for example your game's .exe): `never_open` in the
  settings. Or switch the Processes tab off completely (`processes: enabled: false`): then it does not look at
  other programs at all.
* **Not packed or obfuscated**: a plain Go program, built from the source in this repository.
* It runs at **below-normal priority** and starts helper programs (only `nvidia-smi`, and `powershell.exe` if
  you enable IPMI fan control) at below-normal priority without a window.
* Graphics card numbers come from `nvidia-smi`, NVIDIA's own tool that comes with the driver, started once and
  left running in its "repeat every 2 seconds" mode.
* Temperatures on Windows come from the ACPI thermal zones that Windows itself publishes as performance
  counters, and, only if you switch it on, from the Core Temp program you already run (see
  [Core Temp](#core-temp-optional-windows)). Fan control talks to the server's management chip (BMC) through Windows' own built-in IPMI support.

What it does **not** do on Windows as a result: see [What it can and cannot show](#what-it-can-and-cannot-show).

## Install on Windows

You need: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit), Tailscale installed and signed in, and the file
`fairy-agent-windows-amd64.exe` (plus `install-fairy-agent.ps1` from the `deploy` folder).

**The easy way.** Put both files in one folder, open **PowerShell as Administrator** (right-click the Start
button, "Terminal (Admin)"), go to that folder and run:

```powershell
cd $HOME\Downloads\fairy-agent        # wherever you put the two files
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass   # allows this one script, for this window only
.\install-fairy-agent.ps1 -PanelAddress 100.64.0.2   # the Tailscale address of the machine running the panel
```

Add `-LocalSystem` on a PC where you want fan control (see [Fan control](#fan-control-supermicro)).

**What the script does, step by step** (you can also type these yourself):

```powershell
# 1. copy the program to a folder only administrators can change
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "C:\Program Files\Fairy" | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\fairy-agent-windows-amd64.exe "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe"
Unblock-File "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe"

# 2. install the service (starts automatically with Windows, a little after boot, restarts itself on failure).
#    This also creates C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent with config.yaml, token and control-token, readable only by
#    administrators, SYSTEM and the service itself.
& "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe" install          # or: install --account LocalSystem

# 3. let only the panel in: TCP 9101, only on the Tailscale adapter, only from Tailscale addresses
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Fairy agent (Tailscale only)" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow `
  -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 9101 -RemoteAddress 100.64.0.0/10 -InterfaceAlias Tailscale `
  -Program "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe"

# 4. check the settings and start it
& "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe" check-config
Start-Service fairy-agent
```

The service runs as **LocalService**, a built-in Windows account with very few rights. That is enough for
everything except two things, which need **LocalSystem** (`install --account LocalSystem`):

* fan control and BMC sensors through Windows' IPMI support (Windows only lets administrators use it), and
* full details for programs of other accounts in the Processes tab. As LocalService the agent can open only
  programs running under its own account; everything else (your games, your browser) is listed **by name only**,
  without CPU, memory or user. For many people that is a feature.

Shutdown / reboot and Wake-on-LAN work as LocalService.

By default the agent listens on this PC's Tailscale address, port 9101 (it finds it by itself). It never listens
on your home network or the internet unless you set `listen:` yourself.

## Install on Linux

You need: Linux with systemd (Debian, Ubuntu, Proxmox VE, Fedora...), amd64 or arm64 (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4/5),
Tailscale signed in. As root:

```sh
# 1. a user for the agent, the program, the settings folder
useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin fairy-agent
install -m 0755 fairy-agent-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/fairy-agent      # or fairy-agent-linux-arm64
install -d -m 0750 -o root -g fairy-agent /etc/fairy-agent
install -m 0640 -o root -g fairy-agent deploy/fairy-agent.config.example.yaml /etc/fairy-agent/config.yaml

# 2. the tokens (the panel needs the same ones, see below)
fairy-agent gen-token > /etc/fairy-agent/token
fairy-agent gen-token > /etc/fairy-agent/control-token   # only used if you enable fan / power / Wake-on-LAN
chown root:fairy-agent /etc/fairy-agent/token /etc/fairy-agent/control-token
chmod 0640 /etc/fairy-agent/token /etc/fairy-agent/control-token

# 3. the service
install -m 0644 deploy/fairy-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/fairy-agent.service
sudo -u fairy-agent fairy-agent check-config
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now fairy-agent
systemctl status fairy-agent       # should say "fairy-agent listening" with your 100.x.y.z:9101
```

The service runs as the `fairy-agent` user with **no special rights** (no root, no capabilities) and is locked
down by systemd (read-only system, no new privileges, its own /tmp, only NVIDIA and IPMI devices visible).
Three optional extras need a small permission each, and only if you want them:

| You want | Install | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU watts (Intel/AMD "RAPL") | `deploy/fairy-agent.tmpfiles.conf` as `/etc/tmpfiles.d/fairy-agent.conf`, then `systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/fairy-agent.conf` | the energy counters are root-only since 2020 (a side-channel fix); this lets the agent's group read them |
| Shutdown / reboot from the panel | `deploy/fairy-agent.polkit.rules` as `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-fairy-agent.rules` | lets exactly this user power off / reboot through systemd |
| BMC sensors / fan control in-band | `apt install ipmitool`, `deploy/fairy-agent.udev.rules` as `/etc/udev/rules.d/60-fairy-agent-ipmi.rules`, `modprobe ipmi_devintf ipmi_si`, `udevadm trigger` | lets the agent's group use /dev/ipmi0 |

Temperatures, fans and voltages of the board come from `/sys/class/hwmon` and need nothing extra.

If the firewall on the machine is on (nftables/ufw), allow TCP 9101 only on `tailscale0`, e.g.
`ufw allow in on tailscale0 to any port 9101 proto tcp`.

## Point the panel at it

On the panel, two files change: `/etc/fairy/fairy.env` (the secrets) and `/etc/fairy/config.yaml`.

1. Copy the agent's token. Windows (PowerShell as Administrator): `Get-Content C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent\token`.
   Linux: `cat /etc/fairy-agent/token`.
2. On the panel, add it to `/etc/fairy/fairy.env` under a name of your choice, one per machine:

   ```sh
   AGENT_TOKEN_NSX_CYRENE=paste-the-token-here
   # only if you enable fan control, shutdown/reboot or Wake-on-LAN on that machine:
   AGENT_CONTROL_TOKEN_NSX_CYRENE=paste-the-control-token-here
   ```
3. Add the machine to `agents:` in `/etc/fairy/config.yaml` (the address is the machine's Tailscale address):

   ```yaml
   agents:
     - id: nsx-cyrene
       name: NSX-CYRENE
       url: http://100.64.0.10:9101
       token_env: AGENT_TOKEN_NSX_CYRENE
       group: Neptune
       site: Neptune
       # optional, each must also be switched on in the agent's config.yaml:
       # fan_control: {vendor: supermicro, control_token_env: AGENT_CONTROL_TOKEN_NSX_CYRENE}
       # power_control: true
       # control_token_env: AGENT_CONTROL_TOKEN_NSX_CYRENE   # (needed for power_control / wol_relay)
   ```
   For an agent on a Proxmox node, add `node: <node name>` so its details are shown on that node.
4. Restart the panel: `systemctl restart fairy`. The machine appears within a second or two.

The connection is plain HTTP inside Tailscale (which already encrypts everything between your machines). The
token travels in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

## Optional features

Everything below is **off** until you switch it on in the agent's `config.yaml` **and** in the panel's
`agents:` entry. Each one uses the separate control token, is limited to 12 requests a minute, and is written
to the agent's log. Restart the agent after changing `config.yaml`.

### Fan control (Supermicro)

For Supermicro boards with a BMC (X9 to X12, e.g. the X11SCA-F): choose the BMC's fan mode (standard, full,
optimal, heavy IO) and, in "full" mode, a fixed speed per fan zone.

```yaml
ipmi:
  enabled: true
fan_control:
  enabled: true
  min_duty: 30          # never below 30 %
  max_temp_c: 80        # watchdog
```

Safety: the agent refuses any speed below 30 % (the panel does too). While you have set a fixed speed, it checks
the CPU temperature every 10 seconds; at 80 °C, or if it cannot read any temperature for 30 seconds, it sets
both zones back to 100 % and writes that in the fan log the panel shows.

On Windows this uses Windows' own IPMI support through one `powershell.exe` the agent starts when needed (and
stops after 5 idle minutes), so the service must run as LocalSystem (`install --account LocalSystem`). The first
reading of the BMC's sensor list can take a minute. On Linux it uses `ipmitool` (see the table above).
`ipmi.enabled` alone (without `fan_control`) adds the BMC's temperatures, fan speeds and voltages to the panel.

### Shutdown and reboot

```yaml
power_control:
  enabled: true
```

Panel: `power_control: true` and `control_token_env:` in the agent's entry. The panel asks you to type the
machine's name and sends a delay (default 60 s). On Windows, Windows itself shows its usual "you're about to be
signed out" warning and counts down (like `shutdown /s /t 60`; open programs are closed at the end); Cancel in
the panel aborts it. On Linux the agent waits and then runs `systemctl poweroff` / `reboot` (needs the polkit
rule above); if the agent is restarted in the meantime, the pending action is dropped.

### Wake-on-LAN

```yaml
wol:
  enabled: true
  allowed_macs: ["3c:ec:ef:00:11:22"]   # optional: only these machines
```

Panel: `wol_relay: true` and `control_token_env:` in this agent's entry, and `wol: {mac: ..., relay: <this
agent's id>}` under `systems:` for the machine to wake. The agent only sends to the LAN broadcast address or a
private (192.168.x.x / 10.x / 172.16-31.x) address, on port 7 or 9.

### Plugs and UPSes on this machine's network

When the panel cannot reach a smart plug or UPS itself (for example at a friend's place), the agent there can
read it and pass the readings on. The entries are the same as in the panel's `power_sources:` and `ups:`
(Shelly, Tasmota, Tuya, Redfish, NUT); passwords go into a separate file named by `env_file:` as
`NAME=value` lines and stay on that machine. `system_hint: self` links a plug to the agent's own machine. In the
panel's agent entry use `power_links:` / `ups_powers:` / `ups_names:` as for any agent.

## What it can and cannot show

| | Linux | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU %, memory, disks, network, uptime | yes | yes |
| Load average | yes | no (Windows has none) |
| CPU model, board / system model, BIOS | yes | yes |
| NVIDIA GPU (use, memory, temperature, watts) | yes (nvidia-smi) | yes (nvidia-smi) |
| AMD / Intel GPU | no | no |
| CPU temperature | yes (coretemp / k10temp) | only what the BIOS publishes as an ACPI thermal zone, often nothing or a fixed value; per core with [Core Temp](#core-temp-optional-windows) |
| Board fans and voltages | yes (hwmon chips) | only through the BMC (Supermicro, `ipmi:`) |
| CPU watts | yes (RAPL, see the table above) | only with [Core Temp](#core-temp-optional-windows) |
| Battery | watts and state | state only |
| Processes | all, with command lines (passwords blanked) | all names; details for programs it may open; the program's path instead of its command line; no per-program GPU memory |

**Not possible on Windows without a driver**, and therefore never done: CPU core temperatures, CPU package
watts, motherboard sensor chips (fans, voltages), and other programs' command-line arguments. Tools that show
these (HWiNFO, LibreHardwareMonitor, Afterburner) load a kernel driver, which is exactly what anti-cheat
software watches for. On a Supermicro board the BMC fills most of the gap (CPU temperature, fans, voltages).
The panel simply leaves out what the agent does not send.

## Core Temp (optional, Windows)

[Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) is a free Windows program that shows the temperature of every CPU
core and the CPU's power draw. It reads them with **its own** kernel driver, and it offers those readings to
other programs through a documented shared-memory block
([developer page](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/developers.html)). With `sensors: coretemp: true` fairy-agent
copies that block every couple of seconds and shows the cores as "Core 0", "Core 1"... (with Tj. Max as the
critical value) and the CPU package watts as "CPU watts", exactly where Linux machines show theirs. The fan
watchdog counts them as CPU temperatures.

**Anti-cheat:** fairy-agent itself still loads no driver and only opens the block read-only. The driver that
anti-cheat software can see is Core Temp's, the same situation as running Core Temp without fairy-agent. If a
game objects to Core Temp, close Core Temp before playing: the agent notices, writes one line in its log and
carries on without those readings (and picks them up again when Core Temp comes back).

**Set it up:**

1. Install Core Temp and start it. In *Options > Settings*: on *General* tick **Start Core Temp with Windows**
   (Core Temp does this with a scheduled task, as administrator) and on *Display* tick **Start Core Temp
   minimized** (and, if you like, *Close Core Temp to the notification area*).
2. Still in *Options > Settings*, on *Advanced*, tick **Enable global shared memory (SNMP)**. This is needed:
   without it Core Temp shares its readings only inside your own Windows sign-in session, and the fairy-agent
   service (like every service) runs outside it. In `CoreTemp.ini` this is `SnmpSharedMemory=1` under
   `[Advanced]`.
3. The fairy-agent service must run as **LocalSystem** (`install-fairy-agent.ps1 -LocalSystem`, or
   `install --account LocalSystem`; the same as for fan control). Core Temp runs as administrator and does not
   open its readings to other accounts, so the default LocalService account is turned away ("access denied" in
   the agent's log).
4. In `C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent\config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   sensors:
     coretemp: true
   ```

   then `Restart-Service fairy-agent`. The log says "Core Temp readings available" once it has found them.

The agent looks for `Global\CoreTempMappingObjectEx` first, then the older `CoreTempMappingObject`, then the
same names in the signed-in user's session. Core Temp has no CPU package *temperature* in its shared block, so
only the cores are shown. Core Temp's Fahrenheit and "distance to Tj. Max" display options are converted back to
°C. Package watts appear only when Core Temp shows a "Power" value for your CPU.

## Settings (config.yaml)

The file is `C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent\config.yaml` (Windows) or `/etc/fairy-agent/config.yaml` (Linux).
`deploy/fairy-agent.config.example.yaml` lists every setting with an explanation. The important ones:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listen` | the Tailscale address, port 9101 | where the panel connects; `0.0.0.0` is refused unless `allow_all_interfaces: true` |
| `token_file`, `control_token_file` | `token`, `control-token` next to config.yaml | the tokens (at least 24 characters, different from each other). `FAIRY_AGENT_TOKEN` / `FAIRY_AGENT_CONTROL_TOKEN` in the environment win. Never on the command line. |
| `hide_host_details` | false | no hostname, no hardware model, just "Windows" / "Linux" |
| `processes.enabled` / `cmdline` / `never_open` | true / true / none | the Processes tab |
| `gpu.nvidia_smi` | auto | `off` or a full path |
| `sensors.coretemp` | false | Windows: CPU core temperatures and watts from Core Temp (see [Core Temp](#core-temp-optional-windows)) |
| `ipmi`, `fan_control`, `power_control`, `wol` | off | see [Optional features](#optional-features) |
| `control_rate_per_min` | 12 | all control requests together |
| `log_file` | Windows: `C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent\logs\agent.log` (5 MB, one old copy); Linux: the journal | |

Unknown settings are an error (so a typo does not silently do nothing). `fairy-agent check-config` checks the
file and the tokens without starting anything.

The panel's hints still mention the Python prototype's switches: "--no-processes" is `processes: enabled: false`
and "--enable-power-control" is `power_control: enabled: true` in fairy-agent.

## Checking, logs, updating, removing

* **Is it running?** Windows: `Get-Service fairy-agent`. Linux: `systemctl status fairy-agent`.
* **Logs.** Windows: `Get-Content C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent\logs\agent.log -Tail 30` (start-up problems also go
  to the Event Viewer, Windows Logs > Application, source "fairy-agent"). Linux: `journalctl -u fairy-agent`.
  Logs never contain tokens or passwords.
* **Ask it directly** (from the panel machine):
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://100.64.0.10:9101/metrics`
* **Panel shows the machine offline**: check the firewall rule, that Tailscale is up on both sides, and that the
  token in the panel's `fairy.env` is exactly the one in the agent's `token` file. A wrong token shows up in the
  agent's log as "rejected request".
* **Update.** Windows: run `install-fairy-agent.ps1` again with the new exe (or `Stop-Service fairy-agent`, copy
  the exe over, `Start-Service fairy-agent`). Linux: copy the new binary to `/usr/local/bin/fairy-agent`, then
  `systemctl restart fairy-agent`. Settings and tokens stay.
* **Remove.** Windows: `& "C:\Program Files\Fairy\fairy-agent.exe" uninstall`, then
  `Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Fairy agent (Tailscale only)"` and delete `C:\Program Files\Fairy` and
  `C:\ProgramData\fairy-agent`. Linux: `systemctl disable --now fairy-agent`, delete the unit,
  `/usr/local/bin/fairy-agent` and `/etc/fairy-agent`, and `userdel fairy-agent`.

## Security in short

* Listens only on the Tailscale address (or the address you set), never on every network by default.
* Every request needs a token; tokens are compared in a way that does not leak their length or content through
  timing. Reading uses one token, changing anything needs the second, separate one. Repeated wrong tokens
  block that address for a minute.
* Read-only unless you switch features on; each control action is rate limited and logged with who asked.
* Command lines are cleaned of passwords and tokens before they leave the machine (and again by the panel).
* Time limits on every connection; requests are small and bounded.
* Windows: settings folder readable only by administrators, SYSTEM and the service; the program lives in
  `C:\Program Files`. Linux: own user, no root, no capabilities, systemd sandbox.

## Not yet tested on a real Windows PC

The Windows parts compile and their pure logic is unit-tested, but were not yet run on real Windows. Check these
on the first install and report anything odd:

* the service itself: install / start / stop / uninstall, the folder permissions, the log file, the Event Log
  entry on a failed start, automatic restart;
* CPU %, memory, disks, network counters, uptime, OS name and hardware strings (registry);
* ACPI thermal-zone temperatures (PDH);
* Core Temp's shared memory: which name the service finds (global setting on/off), LocalService vs LocalSystem,
  the values against Core Temp's window (unit conversions, package watts);
* the process list (Toolhelp snapshot + limited handles), LocalService vs LocalSystem;
* nvidia-smi on Windows (looping mode, path detection);
* shutdown / reboot / cancel (InitiateSystemShutdownEx / AbortSystemShutdown) as LocalService;
* IPMI through `powershell.exe` and the Microsoft_IPMI WMI class: the reply format is taken from Microsoft's
  documentation and examples (first byte of the reply = completion code) and has not been seen on a real BMC
  yet. Try `ipmi: enabled: true` first (sensors only) and look at the panel and the log before enabling fan
  control;
* the install script's firewall rule.
